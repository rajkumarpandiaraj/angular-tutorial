    -> it is used to define different configuration for different environment
        like dev environment, test environment, production environment.
    -> we will discuss deeply later.

assets folder :
    ->if we want to add font, extra css etc..

index.html :
    -> It is the first file running on the browser.
    -> we never run code in index.html body.

main.ts :
    -> it is the bridge between angular code and index.html
    -> it will load all the ts file in the index.html

style.css :
    -> here we can write some default/global styles

app folder :
    -> It is the very important folder.
    -> app-routing.module.ts is the file inserted in the index.html file as <app-root></app-root>
