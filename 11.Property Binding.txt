                                    11.Property Binding

Property Binding :
    Bind a property with html element.
    Lets take 2 textbox
    try to enable
    Find differnce between property binding and Interpolation.

In app.component.html
    <input type='text' [disabled] = 'disableBox'/> //disableBox is the property in the ts file, tat property is binded here.
    <input type='text' disabled = {{disableBox}}/> // Interpolation
    // now both the box got disabled in the browser
    <button (click)="enableBox()">enable TextBox</button>

In app.component.ts
disableBox = true
    enableBox(){
        this.disableBox = false
    }


o/p
    if i click the button, first text box{property binded box} got enabled, becoz, property binding can handle the attribute.
