                            19.Pass Data from Parent to child component

Pass  Data to child component
        --> Make users component
        --> make it child of app component
        --> Pass Data from app to child component
        --> Display data in chid component.

1. Make users component
    ng g c users

using this component in app component
    In app.component.html
        <app-users [hero] = 'data'></app-users>

In app.component.ts //parent component
    data = 'bruce'; //it works well for obj and array also.

here data in the parent component is shared it with the child component

Now we have to recieve it in the users component

In users.component.ts
    import {Component, OnInit:Input} from 'angular/cli';

    @component({})
    export class usersComponent implements OnInit(
        @Input() hero ;
        constructor(){ }
        ngOnInit(): void{
            console.log(hero) //we can use that here also
        }
    )

In users.component.html
<h1>{{hero}}</h1>
