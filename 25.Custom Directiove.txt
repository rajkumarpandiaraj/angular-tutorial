What is directive?
    it is used to modify the dom or html element
    ex :
        show/hide element
        change style like that
    ngFor, ngIf, ngSwitch are default directives

creating Custom directive
    --> ng g directive customStyle 
    --> ng g directive <directiveName>

Two file got created
    1.custom-style-directive-specs.ts // used to write test for the directive
    2.custom-style-directive.ts // it is used to write the logic for the directive

In custom-style-directive.ts
    @directive({
        selector : '[appCustomStyle]' //This is the name of the directive
    })

In app.component.html
    <h1>Normal Header</h1>
    <h1 appCustomStyle>Costume Header</h1>

In custom-style-directive.ts
//import ElementRef
import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

    @directive({
        selector : '[appCustomStyle]' //This is the name of the directive
    })
export class CustomStyleDirective{
    constructor(private el:ElementRef){
        el.nativeElement.style.color = 'red';
    }
}

In browser,
    now the custom Header got displayed in red color.
