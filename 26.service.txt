What is service?
    service is the data shared between to two are more component

            Component
                |   
    service -----
                |   
            component

How to make service
    ng g service <serviceName>
    ng g service users

Now two file got created
    1.users.service.ts
    2.users.service.specs.ts

In users.service.ts
    constructor({})
    getData(){
        return{
            name : 'rk',
            age ; 22
        }
    }

To use this in component, you have to register it
In app.component.ts
    import { userService } from ''./user.service

    export class
    name = ''
    constructor(private user:userService){
        this.name = this.user.getData().name
        console.log(this.user.getData()) // {name : 'rk', }
    }

In app.component.html
<h1>{{name}}</h1>
